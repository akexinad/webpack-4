STARTING OFF
============

- To begin, we need to create a webpack.config.js file and give four options:
    1. Entry Point for all the files.
    2. Output.
        - NOTE: The output path folder has to be in absolute, not relative.
    3. Mode.
    4. PublicPath.
        - This tells webpack where all the generated files are located.

- And in our package.json file we prep the build script.
